# Getting Started

1. To get started, select the green "Code" button at the top and download the zip file.
2. Unzip the folder to somewhere convenient
3. Open the command prompt terminal on your computer and navigate to where the folder is located on your local system
4. Once you are in the folder, type the command "npm i" and hit enter, this double checks all the pieces are installed correctly
5. Once this command finishes, type the command "npm start" and hit enter, this will start up the frontend of the application.
6. Open up a second command prompt terminal without closing the first one and navigate back to the folder
7. Once back in the app folder, navigate into the subfolder called "backend" and type the command "node server.js" and hit enter, this will start up the backend server for the application.
8. With both ends running the application should now be accessible from a browser of your choice. Make sure not to close either of the terminals or else you'll have to restart its step.

You may be prompted to download additional software like Node.js in order to run some scripts. If so just follow the download instructions and then retry the commands.

When working in the command prompt terminal these commands are useful:

-   "ls" : this will list out all the contents of whichever folder you are currently in
-   "cd 'insert-folder-name'" : this will navigate the terminal into whichever folder you name
-   "cd .." : this will navigate back out of the current folder and into the parent folder

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
